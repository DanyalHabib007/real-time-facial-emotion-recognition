# Real-Time Facial Emotion Recognition Web App

## Overview

This real-time facial emotion recognition web application combines the capabilities of Streamlit and Flask, with a TensorFlow-powered model for emotion recognition and OpenCV for live facial detection. Users can experience immediate emotion predictions on their webcam feed, making it an interactive and dynamic tool for emotion analysis.

## Features

- **Live Webcam Feed**: Capture real-time video from your webcam for instant facial emotion analysis.

- **Continuous Emotion Prediction**: The application continuously predicts emotions on faces detected in the live feed.

- **Streamlit Interface**: An interactive and user-friendly Streamlit interface enhances the real-time experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for creating a dynamic and responsive web interface

- **Backend**:
  - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) for serving the Streamlit app and managing the real-time aspect
  - [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for live facial detection from the webcam
  - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for the real-time facial emotion recognition model
